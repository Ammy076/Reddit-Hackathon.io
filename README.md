The inspiration for Subreddit Conquest stems from the idea of transforming the Reddit community into an interactive gaming experience. By combining the competitive and collaborative spirit of subreddits with classic strategy games, word puzzles, and tabletop mechanics, we wanted to create a fun, engaging game.
